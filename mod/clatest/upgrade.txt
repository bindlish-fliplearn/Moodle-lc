This files describes API changes in the clatest code.

=== 3.5 ===
* Removed questionbank.ajax.php. Please use the clatest_question_bank fragment instead.
* Adding "random" questions to a clatest via clatest_add_clatest_question() has been deprecated. Please use clatest_add_random_questions().

=== 3.3.2 ===

* clatest_refresh_events() Now takes two additional parameters to refine the update to a specific instance. This function
  now optionally takes the module instance object or ID, and the course module object or ID. Please try to send the full
  objects instead of the ids to save DB calls.

=== 3.2 ===

* External functions mod_clatest_external::get_attempt_data, mod_clatest_external::get_attempt_summary
  and mod_clatest_external::get_attempt_review now return additional optional fields:
   - blockedbyprevious: Whether a question is blocked by the previous question.

=== 3.1 ===

* clatest_attempt::question_print_comment_fields() has been removed. It was broken
  since at least Moodle 2.0.

* clatest::confirm_start_attempt_message and mod_clatest_view_object::$startattemptwarning
  have been deprecated. This functionality is now entirely handled within the
  clatest access rule plugins.

* The third argument to mod_clatest_renderer::start_attempt_button has been changed
  from a warning string to a mod_clatest_preflight_check_form.

* mod_clatest_renderer::review_next_navigation has a new optional argument. If you
  have overridden that method, consider updating your code to match.

* mod_clatest\output\edit_renderer::start_section_list now takes $structure as an
  argument. If you have overridden this method (it's hard to believe anyone ever
  would) you will need to update your renderer.

* Several methods relating to preview links/buttons/urls have a new optional
  argument to make the preview be of a particular variant.


=== 2.9 ===

* There have been changes in classes/output/edit_renderer.php for MDL-40990.
  + Some methods use to take $structure & $question as the first two arguments.
    They now take $structure & $slot number. If you need $question, you can get
    it using $question = $structure->get_question_in_slot($slot);
  + Some methods used to take $clatest & $question. They now take $structure & $slot
    number. You can get $question as above. $clatest is $structure->get_clatest().
  + initialise_editing_javascript has had some redundant arguments removed.
  Hopefully, with these changes, we will have less need to make other changes in future.

* Due to MDL-40992, you should be aware that extra slots can get added to an attempt.
  You may get slot numbers beyone the end of the original clatest layout, and you
  may want to call $attemptobj->get_original_slot to find where the question
  originally came from.

* You now need to pass an instance of the mod_clatest_renderer if you call
  $attemptobj->render_question or $attemptobj->render_question_at_step.

* The array values in mod_clatest_links_to_other_attempts may now be either a moodle_url,
  or renderable (or null). Previously they could only be a moodle_url or null.

* The contents of the navigation block is now not just clatest_nav_question_button-s.
  It can also contain clatest_nav_section_heading-s. If you have overridden
  mod_clatest_renderer::navigation_panel, then you may need to account for this.
  This change also has implications for the Edit clatest page.


=== 2.8 ===

* Classes that were defined in various lib files have been moved to the classes
  folder to take advantage of auto-loading. This has involved renaming them.
  see the list in mod/clatest/db/renamedclasses.php.

* The clatest no longer handles its own \mod_clatest\event\attempt_becameoverdue event,
  and so the event handler function clatest_attempt_overdue_handler has been deleted.
  Also, the internal function clatest_send_overdue_message has add the arguments
  changed. It now takes the $attemptobj object, not separate stdClass objects.

* Major changes to the Edit clatest page.

  The goal of this work was to increase usability, and also clean up the page
  enough that it will be possible to add new features in future.

  Display of mod/clatest/edit.php is now entirely generated by
  mod_clatest\output\edit_renderer. This uses a helper class mod_clatest\structure
  to provide details of the structure of the clatest, and mod_clatest\repaginate to
  alter that structure. (Actually, there are still some modification methods on
  mod_clatest\structure. Expect that to be cleaned up in future.)

  The new code uses much more ajax, and there are new scripts mod/clatest/edit_rest.php
  and mod/clatest/repaginate.php to handle this. (Again, don't be surprised if those
  two scripts get merged in future.) Also questionbank.ajax.php (which may, in
  future, be made more generic, and moved into the core question bank code.)

  As a result of this, mod/clatest/editlib.php has gone. (A few remaining functions
  were moved to locallib.php.)

  Here is a list of all the old functions or classes that have changed.
  If you used any of these in custom code, you will need to update your code.
  (Note that many of these functions should have been considered private internals
  of the clatest module, and you should not have been using them!)

  From editlib.php:
      clatest_remove_slot
      clatest_delete_empty_page
      clatest_add_page_break_after_slot    - Use methods of structure or repaginate
      clatest_update_slot_maxmark          - classes instead.
      _clatest_move_question
      clatest_move_question_up
      clatest_move_question_down

      clatest_print_question_list
      clatest_print_pagecontrols
      clatest_print_singlequestion         - Use methods of edit_renderer instead.
      clatest_print_randomquestion
      clatest_print_singlequestion_reordertool
      clatest_print_randomquestion_reordertool
      print_random_option_icon
      clatest_print_grading_form
      clatest_print_status_bar

  Moved from editlib.php to locallib.php:
      clatest_question_tostring - now always returns a string (the only option used).
                               The $return argument has gone.

  Old editing JavaScript (e.g. mod/clatest/edit.js) is gone. Replaced with YUI modules.


=== 2.7.1 ===

* The function clatest_fire_attempt_started_event has been removed. This function
  should not have been used outside the clatest, but if you were using it, you should
  trigger the event outside this function. Note that the appropriate start event is
  fired automatically by the clatest_attempt_save_started function.


=== 2.7 ===

* The old clatest.questions database column (comma-separated list of question ids)
  is gone, and instead the clatest_question_instances table has been renamed to
  to clatest_slots. Some of the columns of that table have been renamed to match
  the coding guidelines. Specifically:
      clatest     -> clatestid
      question -> questionid
      grade    -> maxmark
  also there are two new columns:
      slot     -  numbers the questions in the clatest in order, as on the edit clatest page.
      page     -  new way to determine which question is on which page.
  naturally, other parts of the code and APIs have been updated to reflect that
  change.

* The following functions, which were part of the internal workings of the clatest,
  have been removed.
      clatest_get_slot_for_question
      clatest_number_of_questions_in_clatest
      clatest_repaginate               (there is now a clatest_repaginate_questions with a different API).
      clatest_add_page_break_at        (see clatest_add_page_break_after_slot)
      clatest_add_page_break_after     (see clatest_add_page_break_after_slot)
      clatest_number_of_pages
      clatest_remove_question          (see clatest_remove_slot)
      clatest_update_question_instance (see clatest_update_slot_maxmark)

* The following internal functions have had their API changed.
      clatest_delete_empty_page: has had its arguments changed to $clatest and $pagenumber.
      clatest_has_question_use: now takes $clatest and $slot, not $questionid.


=== 2.6 ===

* As part of improving the page usability and accessibility, we updated the
  heading levels for clatest module so it has a proper nesting. (MDL-41615)

* mod_clatest_renderer::view_best_score has been removed. (It did not do what the
  name suggested anyway.)


=== 2.4 ===

* mod_clatest_renderer::finish_review_link now requires $attemptobj to be passed in
  instead of a moodle_url.


=== Earlier changes ===

* Were not documented in this way. Sorry.
